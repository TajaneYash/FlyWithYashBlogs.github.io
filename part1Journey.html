                                    <p>In the quiet of my childhood bedroom, with posters of airplanes adorning 
                                        the walls and dreams of soaring through the skies, I nurtured a desire to 
                                        become a pilot. Fast-forward to my university years, while amidst the rigors 
                                        of engineering studies, that childhood passion found a new outlet: REMOTE 
                                        CONTROLLED PLANES. As an enthusiast, I poured hours into perfecting flight 
                                        techniques, tinkering with the design, and immersing myself in the world of 
                                        aerodynamics. Little did I know then, that my journey would lead me to the doors 
                                        of Aero Club, where I'd find a community of like-minded individuals and a platform 
                                        to further pursue my passion.Today, as I stand at the helm of the Aero Club as its 
                                        President, my love for RC planes burns as brightly as ever, reminding me  </p>

                            <p>  that no matters 
                                    that my life takes me, I will forever be a hobbyist at heart, reminding me that the sky 
                                    is not just a canvas for dreams but a playground where passion takes flight. In my first 
                                    year of college, amid the challenges of the pandemic, I found myself immersed in the world 
                                    of online lectures and virtual meets. However, a visit to campus to pay my fees during the 
                                    corona period opened my eyes to different reality. I witnessed students from various club 
                                    enjoying their engineering days offline, actively engaged in club activities while I remained 
                                    confined to my virtual world. The contrast sparked a curiosity 
                                    within me, igniting a desire to be part of the vibrant club culture on campus.</p>

                                <p>The turning point came when I stumbled upon a Google meet 
                                    interview for the technical club [MITAOE AERO CLUB] on 1st Sep 2021. Unbeknownst 
                                    to the seniors conducting the interview, they mistook me for a second-year student, 
                                    bombarding me with questions related to subjects I had yet to encounter. It was 
                                    until I clarified that I am First Year student. This situation I gracefully bowed
                                    out of the unexpected interrogation, leaving the meeting with a mixture of amusement 
                                    and disbelief. As fate would have it, on 9th Sep 2021, I received an unexpected email 
                                    notifying me of my selection. However, my journey as technical club member did not truly begin until three months later in January.</p>

                                        A call from the club captain Anuj Bhaskar, 
                                        changed everything. He extended an invitation for me to join the team, offering me a 
                                        place to showcase my talents and contributor to the club's endeavors. The first day proved 
                                        to be a daunting challenge as I struggled to grasp complex aerodynamics concepts. Yet, 
                                        during the difficulty, a passion for design emerged. Determined to excel in designing RC 
                                        planes, I embarked on a journey of self-learning, immersing myself in aerodynamics principle 
                                        and design techniques. And thus, my journey into the technical club began- a tale of unexpected 
                                        twists, humorous mishaps, and newfound passions.

                            </div>
                            <p>Despite the initial hurdles, I embraced the 
                                opportunity with enthusiasm, eager to learn, grow and make my mark within the club community.
                                Now, my journey in Aero club began as a member of Team Blitzkrieg. The name itself evoked the 
                                unstoppable strategy of Hitler war machine. Our team specialized in manufacturing regular class 
                                aircrafts with wingspan exceeding 2 meters, and I was assigned to the Airframe department. My 
                                responsibilities included designing the fuselage, overseeing the landing gear, and analyzing 
                                the take-off and landing performance of RC planes. I worked alongside a talented group of individuals, 
                                each bringing their unique expertise to the table. Leading the squad was Anuj Bhaskar, whose mastery 
                                of aerodynamics, CFD and avionics guided our endeavors. Ritul Chirde served as the Vice Captain, 
                                bringing his visionary perspective to the team's direction. Pramodini Patil, hailed as the CFD expert, 
                                possed a formidable intellect capable of tackling any challenge. Pooja Khente, affectionally known as 
                                the Ironwoman, was our backbone in the structures department, while Sandeep Kulkarni brought a 
                                laid-back charm to the team while excelling in structural design. Lastly Smit Ambhore, my classmate, 
                                a fellow member with extraordinary qualities, occasionally plugged by confusion. Together, we formed 
                                a cohesive unit, blending the experience of five seniors with the fresh perspective of junior member 
                                like myself. It was within this dynamic team environment that I found my place, eager to contribute 
                                and learn from the wealth of knowledge surrounding me.</p>

                                <p>During my first technical fest at college, "Nakshatra," I stumbled upon 
                                    an event called Club Mela, which I had previously been unaware of. It was a day dedicated 
                                    to showcasing the achievements and projects of various clubs on campus. My captain reached 
                                    out to me, informing me of a presentation task for which second-year students from the club 
                                    were needed. As I navigated through the event, I realized the significance of Club Mela. 
                                    Each club had its tent, proudly displaying models, achievements, and engaging in technical 
                                    discussions and games. It was evident that other technical teams boasted numerous awards, 
                                    while ours had none to showcase besides certificates. That day, I made a vow to myself: 
                                    I would be the catalyst for a new era of award-winning achievements within our club. 
                                    During Club Mela, we presented our models and even conducted virtual flying demonstrations 
                                    for fellow students. It was during this event that I had the opportunity to meet alumni of 
                                    the club, Vasundhara Didi and Sudhanshu Dada. Their intelligence, motivation, and willingness 
                                    to help left a lasting impression on me. They offered valuable guidance in design and various 
                                    other aspects, inspiring me to strive for excellence in my endeavors.</p>

                                        In May 2022, the time had come for the first workshop of SAE Aero Design challenge 2022 in Chennai. 
                                    Excitement filled the air as Anuj, Smit, Aashish, Aditya and I prepared to represent two teams from 
                                    our college. It was my inaugural experience traveling outside Maharashtra, and the prospect of a 
                                    train journey added to anticipation. Booking our tickets, we found ourselves on the waiting list, 
                                    hoping for a last-minute confirmation. However, luck was not on our side tickets were eventually 
                                    cancelled. Determined not to miss the workshop, we embarked on the journey regardless, finding seats 
                                    wherever we could on train. Arriving in Chennai, we were greeted with confusion as we navigated unfamiliar 
                                    streets, searching for our hotel. The location was distant from the station, and the address provided 
                                    led us astray. After much effort, we finally secured rooms late into night. The next day, we made our 
                                    way to REC College for workshop. Despite the challenges, the day proved to be enlightening as we delved 
                                    into basics of aerodynamics and engaged in hands on sessions building plane. Memories were made, and 
                                    lessons were learned, reminding us of value in every journey, as we returned home to Pune after five 
                                    eventful days, we reflected on experiences gained and resolved to be better prepared for future 
                                    endeavors. Home, with its familiar comforts, welcomed me back, marking the end of a memorable journey 
                                    filled with challenges and growth.

                            </div>
                            
                        </div>
                        <div class="row">
                            <div class="col-md-7">
                                <p>In July, excitement buzzed through our team as we received the message from 
                                    SAE detailing the dates of the upcoming competition: 1st, 2nd, and 3rd September.
                                     With tickets booked, our focus shifted to manufacturing, knowing that time was 
                                     of the essence. However, we faced a dilemma—we had not yet begun production. 
                                     Determined to make the most of the opportunity, all seven of us drafted a letter 
                                     to our college, requesting a 1.5-month holiday for dedicated manufacturing, video 
                                     shooting, and flight testing. While some materials had already been purchased, 
                                     others still needed to be sourced from local vendors. Stepping up to the plate, 
                                     I took on the responsibility of liaising with these vendors, utilizing my bike 
                                     as a means of transport. This newfound responsibility not only expanded my 
                                     network within the field but also provided me with valuable insights into 
                                     procurement processes. As manufacturing commenced, I quickly learned that not 
                                     every problem required a technical solution—sometimes, a bit of ingenuity or 
                                     "jugaad" was all that was needed. Despite the challenges, our team persevered, 
                                     and soon the entire plane design was completed. The time had come for the crucial
                                      flight tests. Organizing the logistics for the flight tests was no small feat,
                                       but with careful planning and coordination, we managed to schedule a date with
                                        our pilot, Takte sir. On the day of the tests, the memory of jokes about the
                                         quaint village of "Lavale" brought a light-heartedness to the nerves that 
                                         accompanied me, Soham, Ritul and Aashish to the flight ground. With bated
                                          breath, we watched as our plane took off, fearing the worst but hoping 
                                          for the best. Although there were some minor setbacks during the flight 
                                          round, we managed to complete it with only small failures. Returning to 
                                          college, we diligently addressed these issues, conducting further flights 
                                          over the next few days to ensure our plane was in optimal condition. With 
                                          the flight tests completed, our focus shifted to packaging the plane for 
                                          transport to Chennai. Despite the challenges of fitting everything into a 
                                          limited space, we managed to pack everything into several boxes and a trunk, 
                                          weighing a hefty 10 to 15 kilograms. With our preparations complete, we were
                                           ready to embark on the next chapter of our journey—off to Chennai for the 
                                           competition. Stay tuned for the next installment to learn about our experiences
                                            at the competition and beyond.</p>
